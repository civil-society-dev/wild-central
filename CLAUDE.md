## Project Overview

Wild-cloud Central is a bash-based infrastructure setup system for creating inexpensive Linux machines that serve as the central component of a "wild-cloud". The system currently focuses on setting up a dnsmasq server that provides DNS and PXE services for clustering, with plans to evolve into a web service with JSON API.
