## Quick Reference Guide

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Setup & Initialization
wild-init                    # Initialize new cloud
wild-setup                   # Complete deployment
wild-health                  # System health check

# Application Management
wild-apps-list              # List available apps
wild-app-add <app>          # Configure app
wild-app-deploy <app>       # Deploy app

# Configuration
wild-config <key>           # Read config

## Common Agent Tasks

### When Users Ask About...

**"How do I deploy X?"**
- Check apps-system.md for application management
- Look for X in available applications list
- Reference app deployment lifecycle

**"Setup isn't working"**
- Review setup-process.md for troubleshooting
- Check bin-scripts.md for command options
- Verify prerequisites and dependencies

**"How do I configure Y?"**
- Check configuration-system.md for config management
- Look at project-architecture.md for file locations
- Review template processing documentation

**"What does wild-X command do?"**
- Reference bin-scripts.md for complete command documentation
- Check command categories and usage patterns
- Look at dependencies between commands

### Development Tasks

**Creating New Apps**:
1. Review apps-system.md "Creating Custom Apps" section
2. Follow Wild Cloud app structure conventions
3. Use project-architecture.md for file organization
4. Test with standard app deployment workflow

**Modifying Infrastructure**:
1. Check setup-process.md for infrastructure components
2. Review configuration-system.md for template processing
3. Understand project-architecture.md file relationships
4. Test changes carefully in development environment

**Troubleshooting Issues**:
1. Use bin-scripts.md for diagnostic commands
2. Check setup-process.md for component validation
3. Review configuration-system.md for config problems
4. Reference apps-system.md for application issues

## Best Practices for Agents

### Understanding User Context
- Always check if they're in a Wild Cloud directory (look for `.wildcloud/`)
- Determine if they need setup help vs operational help
- Consider their experience level (beginner vs advanced)
- Check what applications they're trying to deploy

### Providing Help
- Reference specific documentation sections for detailed info
- Provide exact command syntax from bin-scripts.md
- Explain prerequisites and dependencies
- Offer validation steps to verify success

### Safety Considerations
- Always recommend testing in development first
- Warn about destructive operations (delete, reset)
- Emphasize backup importance before major changes
- Explain security implications of configuration changes

### Common Gotchas
- `secrets.yaml` has restricted permissions (600)
- Templates need processing before deployment
- Dependencies between applications must be satisfied
- Node hardware detection requires maintenance mode boot

## Documentation Maintenance

This documentation should be updated when:
- New commands are added to `bin/`
- New applications are added to `apps/`
- Infrastructure components change
- Configuration schema evolves
- Best practices are updated

Each documentation file includes:
- Complete coverage of its topic area
- Practical examples and use cases
- Troubleshooting guidance
- References to related documentation

This comprehensive context should enable AI agents to provide expert-level assistance with Wild Cloud projects across all aspects of the system.
